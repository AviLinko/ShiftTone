# ShiftTone

ShiftTone is a lightweight Python application that plays a sound notification when the keyboard language changes (e.g., from Hebrew to English). The application uses pygame for sound playback and runs in the background, notifying users of the active language whenever ALT+SHIFT is pressed to switch languages. The app is designed for Windows, with support for Linux and macOS through appropriate system configurations.

Key Features:

Detects keyboard language changes.
Plays custom sounds for each language.
Runs automatically in the background upon system startup.
